            <p class="storyInfo">Where does this go? I have yet to ask myself that for many months now, Not asking was a mistake to begin with having cost the lives of other living creatures and loved ones around me to suffer. But that mistake has opened my eyes to the truth of my sins, and I will change not only my life but the lives of many including my families and guide them to a better world. A world where no one will ever commit the sins of not recycling properly.</p>
